# JavaScript Navbar Toggle Project

## Overview
This project showcases a simple, yet elegant solution for implementing a navbar toggle using vanilla JavaScript. It's a part of the larger collection of vanilla JavaScript DOM projects aimed at reinforcing DOM manipulation skills without relying on frameworks or libraries.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The navbar adjusts seamlessly to various screen sizes ensuring a consistent user experience across devices.

- **Toggle Mechanism**: With just a click, the navbar expands or collapses. This feature is especially useful for mobile viewports where screen real estate is at a premium.

- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No frameworks, no libraries, just good old plain JavaScript making it lightweight and easy to integrate into any project.

## How It Works

1. **HTML Structure**: The project has a basic HTML structure with a navbar section. This section contains the toggle button and links.

2. **CSS Styling**: Essential styling is applied for responsiveness. The navbar is hidden by default on mobile viewports.

3. **JavaScript Magic**: A JavaScript event listener waits for the toggle button to be clicked. When detected, the navbar's visibility state toggles between shown and hidden.
