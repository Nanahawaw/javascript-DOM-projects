Welcome to the 8th installment of the JavaScript DOM series. Dive into the world of dynamic content rendering with this menu display project. Enhance your JavaScript skills as you populate a menu and add filter capabilities to it.

## 🔍 Objective

The main goal is to create an interactive menu display where items are rendered dynamically using JavaScript. This will help in honing your skills in DOM manipulation, data rendering, and event handling in JS.

## ✨ Features

- **Dynamic Content Rendering**: The menu items will be populated on the webpage using JavaScript.

- **Filter Capability**: Users can filter menu items based on categories like 'Breakfast', 'Lunch', 'Dinner', or any other predefined criteria.

- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the menu display is friendly across various device sizes.

## 🚀 Implementation Steps

1. **Setup Your Project**: Initialize with necessary HTML, CSS, and JS files.

2. **Design the Menu Layout**: With HTML and CSS, craft a basic layout for the menu items.

3. **JavaScript Rendering**: In your JavaScript, store menu items in an array of objects. Details can include `id`, `name`, `category`, `price`, `description`, and `image`. Then, dynamically render these on the page.

4. **Filter Functionality**: Implement event listeners to filter buttons. On click, they should adjust the displayed menu items based on category.
