# Counter 📊


This project is a simple but dynamic counter built purely with JavaScript and manipulated through DOM. A user can increase, decrease, or reset the counter, and the color of the value changes accordingly to provide visual feedback.

## 🌟 Features

- **🔼 Increase Button**: Increments the counter by 1. Changes the counter's color to green.
- **🔽 Decrease Button**: Decrements the counter by 1. Changes the counter's color to red.
- **🔄 Reset Button**: Resets the counter to 0. Changes the counter's color to default.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Load the project in your preferred browser.
2. Interact with the buttons to modify the counter value.
3. Watch the magic happen!

## 🔍 Behind the Scenes

The main logic of this counter revolves around DOM manipulation. Every time a button is clicked, an event listener triggers a function that modifies the counter's value and updates its color.
